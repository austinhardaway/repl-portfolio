I was tasked with creating a Java program that takes as input a well-structured zip file with ~100-150 individual assignments and produces a master list with grades and comments for students. Over the course of the semmester I personally supported 12 assignments as well as creating an underlying system to get the student submissions into a usable format, check for potential pitfalls, compile and run the submissions, and parse out specific pieces of the output that were worth points. This system has saved many, many man-hours of manually compiling, running, and reading program output across 3 undergraduate TA's and 4 graduate TA's. As well as creating and documenting a system to add support for more labs as needed in the future.",
